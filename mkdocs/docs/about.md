# About
I developed Goiabada with the aim of creating a user management container that blends simplicity with efficiency.

While plenty of alternatives exist, some paid, others open source, I felt there was room to build an auth server intuitive for developers of all levels, giving my own personal expression.

I'm committed to make Goiabada forever free and open source, to benefit the community. You can self host it and have total control over the code and data.

The name is inspired by a Brazilian sweet made with guava. I was also keen on choosing a word that started with Go ðŸ˜‰
