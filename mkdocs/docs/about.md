# About

I developed Goiabada with the aim of creating a user management container that is both straightforward and efficient. 

Plenty of alternatives exist, some paid, some open source. Still, I wanted to build something with my own personal expression and with the simplicity that I value.

The name is inspired by a Brazilian sweet made with guava. I was keen on choosing a word that started with Go ðŸ˜‰ And the dessert itself is really good, especially when paired with cheese.
