# About

My motivation for writing Goiabada was to have a straightforward and effective user management container, that I could easily integrate with other software I was developing.

Plenty of alternatives exist, some paid, some open source. Still, I wanted to build something with my own personal expression and with the simplicity that I value.

The name draws inspiration from a Brazilian sweet made with guava. I was keen on choosing a word that started with Go ðŸ˜‰ And the dessert is really good, especially when paired with cheese.
