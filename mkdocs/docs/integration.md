# Integration

To integrate Goiabada with your app, you'll need to explore your platform for an **OAuth2/OpenID Connect client library**. Many platforms provide such libraries for seamless integration.

We'll be adding some examples here in the near future.

The github repository of Goiabada has a browser-based javascript [test client](https://github.com/leodip/goiabada/tree/main/testclients/js-only) that you can use to test Goiabada.
