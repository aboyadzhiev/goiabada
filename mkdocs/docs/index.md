# Welcome to Goiabada

Goiabada is an open-source **authentication** and **authorization** server. 

Goiabada provides a solution for **user management**, allowing application developers to define users, groups, resources and permissions within their software. It also allows the authentication and authorization of server-to-server interactions.

- Written in Go for speed and minimal resource consumption (container image size < 35 MB)
- User-friendly interface
- Support for single sign on (SSO)
- 2 factor authentication support with one-time password (OTP)
- Granular control over resources and permissions, for effective authorization
- Self-service account page enabling users to modify personal and security details
- OAuth2 support, including authorization code flow and client credentials flow
- OpenID Connect support

# Important ⚠️

Goiabada is currently in **pre-release** stage. That means we may make significant changes in terms of feature scope and the structure of the application.

A new version is in the works where the admin console will be split out from the main auth server. Just keep in mind that, before the official first release, things may change.
